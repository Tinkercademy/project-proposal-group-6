## Problems
What problems are people facing?
How are these already being solved?

Teenagers are stressed by their school work and dont have the time or resources to help them relax.

Many gaming,music and chat applications have been made for Teenagers and adults to relax



## Solution
Whatâ€™s your solution, in one sentence?
Can you find an analogy to describe it?

To create an app that provides quick access for someone within the comunity to vent their frustrations so as to detress while gaining recognition for the problems in school
It is like a person that you carry around that responds to your problems.

## Assumptions
What assumptions are we making that the project depends on? 
That people will want to vent about their problems with school and that their stress stems from the fact they are unable to vent their frustrations


## Unique Selling Point
Our version will succeed because its user base will be of a community of like minded individuals so they will feel like they are being recognised by an audience unlike large social media applications like Facebook,Twitter or Reddit where their posts could get drowned out by a large number of people posting or they could even receive negative responses.

## Competitors
What competitors are there? List 5. Surely you can google 5.
Why are we better or different?
1) 247buddy
2) 7cups
3) Reachout:My support Network
4) BetterHelp Counseling 
5) Friend Shoulder
6) Pigeon Hole

Mine is better as the user base is limited to prevent the user base turning toxic over time or there not being proffesional help.
